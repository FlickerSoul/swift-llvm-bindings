# Swift Bindings for LLVM

This project aims at making it easier and more convenient to
use [LLVM](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project) APIs from Swift code.
It relies on the experimental Swift/C++ Interoperability, which allows calling
C++ APIs directly from Swift, removing the need for a C bridging layer.

This is a work-in-progress. The design of the bindings will be changing as
Swift/C++ Interoperability evolves.
